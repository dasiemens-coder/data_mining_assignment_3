    "Reservoir sampling is a randomized algorithm designed to select a fixed-size sample from a stream of data, where the total size of the data is unknown or too large to fit into memory. This technique ensures that each element in the stream has an equal probability of being included in the sample, regardless of its position in the stream. \n",

Specifically, it maintains a reservoir of size \\( k \\), where \\( k \\) is the desired sample size. As new elements are encountered in the stream, they are either added to the reservoir or discarded based on a probabilistic decision. This decision ensures that the sample remains unbiased and representative of the entire data stream.\n",

The algorithm iterates over the edges in the graph, selecting a subset of edges to form the reservoir. This sampled subset can then be used for further analysis, such as estimating graph properties or performing computations on a smaller, manageable subset of the graph.\n",

    "### Part 2: TRIEST Algorithm for Triangle Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "The TRIEST algorithm is a probabilistic approach designed to estimate the number of triangles in a graph. Triangles are fundamental structures in graph analysis, often used to measure clustering coefficients, detect communities, and analyze social networks. However, counting triangles in large graphs can be computationally expensive, especially when the graph cannot fit into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "TRIEST addresses this challenge by using reservoir sampling to maintain a fixed-size subset of edges from the graph. This subset, or reservoir, is updated dynamically as new edges are processed. The algorithm ensures that the sampled edges are representative of the entire graph, enabling accurate triangle estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features of TRIEST:\n",
    "1. **Reservoir Sampling**: A fixed-size reservoir is maintained, and edges are probabilistically added or replaced as the graph is streamed.\n",
    "2. **Triangle Counting**: For each edge added to the reservoir, the algorithm counts the number of triangles it forms with existing edges in the reservoir.\n",
    "3. **Global and Local Estimates**: TRIEST provides both a global estimate of the total number of triangles in the graph and local estimates for individual nodes.\n",
    "4. **Scalability**: The algorithm processes edges in a single pass, making it suitable for large-scale graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation Details:\n",
    "- **Reservoir Management**: Edges are added to the reservoir until it reaches its maximum size. Once full, edges are probabilistically replaced based on the total number of edges processed.\n",
    "- **Triangle Updates**: When a new edge is added, the algorithm identifies common neighbors of the edge's endpoints to count triangles. The triangle counters are updated using a weight factor to account for the sampling process.\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: The algorithm operates in \\( O(M) \\) memory, where \\( M \\) is the reservoir size, and processes each edge in \\( O(d) \\), where \\( d \\) is the average degree of the graph. (O(M*N) worst case)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we implement the TRIEST algorithm and apply it to the Twitter dataset. The algorithm processes the graph's edges, estimates the number of triangles, and provides insights into the graph's structure. This approach is particularly useful for analyzing large-scale networks where exact triangle counting is infeasible.\n",

    "### TRIEST Algorithm Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The TRIEST algorithm was tested with various reservoir sizes to estimate the number of triangles in the graph. **Crucially, the ground truth provided by GraphFrames (`39,247,518`) represents the sum of triangles incident to every vertex. Since each triangle has three vertices, this number counts every triangle three times. The true global count of unique triangles is 39,247,518 / 3 ≈ 13,082,506.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the corrected analysis based on the true count:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Accuracy of Estimates**:\n",
    "    - **Small Reservoirs (Failure to Converge)**: For very small reservoir sizes (e.g., 200), the algorithm estimates 0 triangles. This is expected behavior for sparse graphs like Twitter; with such a small sample, the probability of capturing all three edges of a triangle is statistically negligible.\n",
    "    - **Convergence**: As the reservoir size increases, the estimates rapidly converge toward the true value. With a reservoir size of **500**, the estimate (**12,811,504**) is already remarkably close to the true count of ~13.08 million.\n",
    "    - **High Precision at Large M**: With the largest reservoir size of **1,000,000**, the estimate is **13,088,609**. Compared to the true count (13,082,506), this represents an error of less than **0.05%**. Contrary to the previous analysis, the algorithm demonstrates **extremely high accuracy** when the reservoir is sufficiently large.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Runtime vs. Reservoir Size**:\n",
    "    - The runtime remains relatively flat (~1.5 seconds) for small reservoir sizes but jumps to **8.20 seconds** for the 1,000,000-edge reservoir.\n",
    "    - **Explanation**: This increase is **not** due to memory limits (1 million edges fits easily in RAM), but rather the computational cost of intersections. TRIEST computes the intersection of neighbors for every edge in the stream against the reservoir. A larger reservoir means denser neighborhoods, making these intersection operations computationally more expensive (*O(M)* complexity).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When compared against the correct ground truth, the TRIEST algorithm proves to be **highly effective** for this dataset. While it requires a reservoir size larger than 200 to overcome the graph's sparsity, it achieves near-perfect accuracy with a reservoir of 1 million edges while maintaining a reasonable runtime. The previously observed \"gap\" was a result of misinterpreting the GraphFrames output, not a deficiency in the sampling algorithm."

    "### Challenges in Scalable Triangle Counting\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Sequential Dependency of TRIÈST**\n",
    "    The standard TRIÈST algorithm relies on maintaining a global reservoir state that updates sequentially with each incoming edge. This dependency prevents straightforward parallelization across distributed systems like Spark, as the algorithm cannot be simply split into independent tasks without \"breaking triangles\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Scalability Limits of Exact Counting**\n",
    "    Exact triangle counting algorithms typically require storing the entire graph structure in memory. For large datasets (such as the 1.4M-edge Twitter graph), this high space complexity frequently leads to Out-Of-Memory (OOM) exceptions, rendering exact methods infeasible on hardware with constrained memory resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Accuracy-Efficiency Trade-off**\n",
    "    There is a non-trivial trade-off between estimation accuracy and processing speed. While increasing the reservoir size ($M$) reduces error, it also increases the computational cost of intersection operations per edge ($O(M)$). This makes determining the optimal $M$ a hyperparameter search."
